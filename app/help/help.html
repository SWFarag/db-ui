      On the “Build a query” tab, a user can click the “Add a search term” button to create a second search term. For the first
      term, he or she might, e.g., select “BGC type” as category and enter “nrps” as the search string. For the second term,
      he or she could, e.g., select “monomer” as category and enter “dhpg” as search string, and hit “search”.

      <strong>Query to find NRPS clusters including the monomer dihydroxyphenylglycine (dhpg).</strong>

      <uib-accordion-heading>
        Finding all ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptide clusters in the Genus <i>Streptomyces</i> that
        are not lantipeptides.
      </uib-accordion-heading>
      On the “Build a query” tab, a user could click the “Add a search term” button twice to create a second and third search term.
      For the first term, he or she could select “BGC type” as category and enter “RiPP” as the search string. For the second
      term, “BGC type” would be “lantipeptide”, and the left-hand button should be switched from “AND” to “NOT”. The third
      term, “genus” could be selected as category and “Streptomyces” entered as search string.

      <strong>Query to find RiPPs in <i>Streptomyces</i> that are not lanthipeptides.</strong>
      <hr /> This query currently yields 265 clusters. To save the results for further analysis, the result table can be downloaded
      as CSV file that can then be opened in a spreadsheet application.
