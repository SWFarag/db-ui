    <h3>About the antiSMASH database</h3>
    <p>
      antiSMASH allows the rapid genome-wide identification, annotation and analysis of secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene
      clusters in bacterial and fungal genomes. It integrates and cross-links with a large number of in silico secondary
      metabolite analysis tools. The antiSMASH database contains pre-computed antiSMASH results for bacterial genomes available
      in the NCBI GenBank repository. At the moment, results are only available for bacterial genomes marked as "complete
      genome", to provide the best quality of antiSMASH predictions.
